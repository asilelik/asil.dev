  - in aselsan, copying a test file from network analyzer to pc was very hard. you need to take flash drive from responsible officer( there was only one flash drive ), copy the file from network analyzer to flash drive, connect it to your pc, then copy the file into pc and give back flash drive to responsible officer in order to enable someone else to use it. my main object in this internship was creating a software that will communicate through gpib( there were no usb option ), transfer files byte by byte from distinct location in network analyzer to some other distinct location in pc.
- <a target="_blank" href="https://www.anritsu.com/en-US/test-measurement/devices-components/vector-network-analyzer">network analyzer</a> tester
  - there was a new network analyzer that aselsan might use in its facility. my object was to create an application for testing new network analyzer so that we can compare it with the old ones. i have used both agilent(now keysight) and anritsu's documentation to create it.
- module tester
  - newly created modules needed testing environment. for this requirement, i have created an application for these modules which will handle them regardless of mdoule type. work model of application was sending various signal to module and observing its behaviour at the output. these modules were being used at radar systems.

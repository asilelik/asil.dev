![i have approximate knowledge of many things](/images/curiosity.gif 'curiosity')

I am a curious software engineer who graduated from electrical and electronics engineer. I am from <a href='https://goo.gl/maps/RPvz6o7RUbiinHsY8' target='_blank'>Kastamonu, TR</a>. I lived in <a href='https://goo.gl/maps/mSGMgcwR7ohh5E2r5' target='_blank'>Ankara, TR</a> for 10 years then moved to my current location which is <a href='https://goo.gl/maps/oET3jj1S5sbPXfbGA' target='_blank'>Amsterdam, NL</a>.

I always try to read or watch something to learn. As I gather more information, it becomes harder to find a gist, repository, what I read or watched.
